# Flamingo Cupcake Company

Welcome to the quirky world of the Flamingo Cupcake Company!
...where I've created a weird little bakery menu site.

This is a practice project to get started with Angular and is using version 17.3.0.
Fully responsive down to 320px.

## What's Bakin'?

Since at the end of the day it's all about having fun, you'll find a delightful collection of extravagant cupcake creations, each with its own unique name, description, and -of course- a tiny touch of sweet mayhem.

From the "Flamin-gooo" (our signature dish with a little pink friend on top) to the "Colourful Coincident" (a chaotic explosion of flavors and ingredients), these cupcakes "are sure to tantalize your taste buds and spark your imagination".

## Tricky One

The trickiest part was to implement the functionality that one can leave comments. That was achieved by working with [ngModel], services and data bindings!
A good start with Angular and a fun little project to dive into Angular and explore its vast features and component-based building approach.

As allways: Happy coding!
